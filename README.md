# Crystals Collector Game

This Repo includes HTML, CSS, and jQuery elements that together, along with photos, work together to create a simple game. This game is called "Crystals Collector." Upon loading the game, the player is given a random number between 19 and 120. The player will then be tasked with matching that random value by clicking on the crystals. Each crystal is assigned a random value at the start of the game that stays static every time the crystal is clicked. The player continues to click the various crystals in an attempt to get a total sum that matches the random number given at the start of the game. If the player's total guesses match the random number, they win; if their total guesses exceed the random number, they lose. Their wins and losses are then updated accordingly, and the game is reset with a new random number, and new random static values for each crystal...I did my best to document each step and label it clearly so that the code can (hopefully) be sensical at first glance.

Here's a quick overview of the project itself:

1. What the project does?
   Stated above: provides a fun and basic game written in jQuery

2. Why the project is useful?
   This project provides the elementary building blocks to constructing JavaScript applications using jQuery

   It provides simple examples of what can be done with functions, objects, for/while loops and "if" statements

   It also gives a glimpse into how the worlds of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery JavaScript come to work together in harmony
